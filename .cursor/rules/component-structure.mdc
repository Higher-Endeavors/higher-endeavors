# Component Structure Rules

## File Organization
- Components should be placed in a `components` directory within their feature directory
- Modals should be placed in a `modals` directory within their feature directory
- Shared components should be placed in the appropriate shared components directory

## Component Naming
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Suffix modal components with 'Modal' (e.g., AddExerciseModal)
- Suffix list components with 'List' (e.g., ExerciseList)
- Suffix item components with 'Item' (e.g., ExerciseItem)
## Component Props
- Define interfaces for component props at the top of the file
- Use TypeScript for all component props
- Document required vs optional props in the interface
