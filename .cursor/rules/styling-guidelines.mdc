# Styling Guidelines

## General
- All text and background color combinations **must meet WCAG AA contrast standards** for accessibility.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where appropriate for accessibility.

## Dark Mode
- Use the `dark:` prefix for Tailwind dark mode styles.
- Modal and card backgrounds should use `bg-white` in light mode and `dark:bg-slate-700` (or the site's standard dark card color) in dark mode, unless otherwise specified.
- Inputs in modals/cards should use `dark:bg-gray-200` or `dark:bg-gray-700` as appropriate, with `dark:text-white` and `dark:placeholder-gray-400`.
- Modal headers and labels should use `dark:text-white`.
- Maintain a **consistent color scheme** for all UI elements in both modes.
- Always **test both light and dark modes** for every new component or page.

## Responsive Design
- Use a **mobile-first approach** for all layouts.
- Use Tailwind's breakpoints: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl` for responsive adjustments.
- Test on multiple screen sizes to ensure usability and visual consistency.

## Component Spacing
- Use consistent spacing units (`p-*`, `m-*`, `gap-*`, etc.) throughout the UI.
- Maintain proper visual hierarchy with spacing (e.g., more space between sections than between items in a list).
- Use appropriate padding and margins for all components, especially cards, modals, and lists.

## Cards & Modals
- Cards and modals should have rounded corners (`rounded-lg`), a shadow (`shadow` or `shadow-lg`), and a border if needed.
- In dark mode, use `dark:bg-slate-700` for modal/card backgrounds and `dark:border-gray-700` for borders.
- Modal overlays should use `bg-black bg-opacity-50` for consistency.
- Close buttons in modals should be circular, use an SVG icon, and have clear hover/focus states.

## Inputs & Forms
- Inputs should use `rounded-md`, `border-gray-300`, and `shadow-sm`.
- In dark mode, use `dark:bg-gray-200` or `dark:bg-gray-700` for input backgrounds, `dark:text-white` for text, and `dark:placeholder-gray-400` for placeholders.
- Labels should always be visible and use `dark:text-white` in dark mode.

## Buttons
- Primary action buttons: `bg-blue-600 text-white` with `hover:bg-blue-700`.
- Secondary/cancel buttons: `border border-gray-300 text-gray-700` with `hover:bg-gray-50`; in dark mode, use `dark:text-white dark:border-gray-600 dark:hover:bg-gray-700`.
- All buttons should have `rounded-md` and clear focus states.

## Visual Consistency
- Match the style of new components to existing tools (e.g., Resistance Training, Structural Balance) for a cohesive user experience.
- When in doubt, reference the most recently updated tool for best practices.
