# General

## Project Structure
- The basic project structure is authorization and feature based

## Coding Standards
- Use Typescript strict typing, all files should have a .ts or .tsx extension
- Javascript files, .js or .jsx, are only allowed from third-party packages

### Components
- Functions should only be declared as such, do not use React.FC, as that is an outdated standard. Reference the Structural Balance functionality to see best coding standards. 

### Naming Conventions

#### kebab-case
- This is the default naming convention for top level file names.

#### camelCase
- Variable names
- Function names
- Hooks

#### PascalCase
- React component names
- Typescript types

#### snake_case
- Postgres/ Backend functionality
- Database column names

## Assumptions
- We will not be using edge deployment for the time being.
