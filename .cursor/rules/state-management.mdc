# State Management Rules

## Local State
- Use useState for component-level state
- Keep state as close as possible to where it's used
- Use TypeScript for state types
## Modal State
- Use boolean state for modal visibility
- Include onClose handler in props
- Handle state cleanup on unmount

## Data Loading
- Use loading states for async operations
- Handle error states appropriately
- Show appropriate loading indicators
