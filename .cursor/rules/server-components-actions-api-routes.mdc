# Rule: Server Components, Server Actions, and API Routes

## Server Components
- Use for all data-heavy, read-only, or SEO-critical content.
- Fetch data directly from databases or APIs on the server.
- Render static or semi-static content that does not require interactivity.
- Do not use browser APIs, event handlers, or React hooks like `useState` in server components.
- Pass only serializable data as props to client components.

## Server Actions
- Use for all mutations (create, update, delete) that originate from forms or UI actions within the app.
- Implement as async functions with the `'use server'` directive.
- Use as the `action` prop on forms, or call imperatively from client components.
- Handle server-side validation, database mutations, and cache revalidation within server actions.
- Prefer server actions over API routes for internal app mutations for better type safety and simplicity.

## API Routes
- Use for public APIs, webhooks, or endpoints that must be accessed by non-Next.js clients (e.g., mobile apps, integrations).
- Implement in the `app/api` directory.
- Handle multiple HTTP methods and return JSON or other response formats as needed.
- Use for complex request/response handling or when fine-grained control over HTTP is required.
